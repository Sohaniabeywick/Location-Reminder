About
-----------------

Our React Native front end seamlessly integrates with the Location Reminder backend to provide users with an intuitive and efficient experience. Leveraging Google Location Services, the app ensures accurate location tracking, enabling users to discover nearby places of interest effortlessly.

To enhance user interactivity, the application requests necessary internet permissions, facilitating real-time updates and interactions. The React Native app employs a robust SQLite database for efficient local storage, ensuring a smooth offline experience.

Through a well-designed user interface, users can easily manage and view location-based reminders, making the app an indispensable tool for those on the go. With a focus on simplicity and functionality, our React Native front end brings the power of location-aware features to users' fingertips
