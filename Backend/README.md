About
-----------------

The Location Reminder application utilizes advanced technologies to suggest the nearest places of interest based on user preferences. It employs a robust K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model, trained on latitude and longitude data stored in a MySQL database. The backend is powered by FastAPI, providing efficient and secure communication between the front end and the database.

The application incorporates a user-friendly form concept, allowing users to input their desired location and preferences seamlessly. The backend leverages the Google Places API to fetch real-time information about nearby places, ensuring accurate and up-to-date suggestions. The entire system is deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance, ensuring scalability and reliability. Users can receive personalized recommendations for places to visit, making the Location Reminder application a cutting-edge solution for personalized and intelligent location-based suggestions.
